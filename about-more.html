          <h3>How did I start my career as UI Designer?</h3>

          <p>Back in 2013 when I was a recent graduate of Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology, <a href="https://www.voyagerinnovation.com/" target="_blank">Voyager Innovations Inc.</a> was just starting up. Fortunately, I was given the privilege to be part of its unique cadetship program with benefits a fresh graduate could ever ask for. I started as an "Associate UI Designer", a job title not yet popular in the Philippines at that time.</p>

          <p>And after a year of close mentorship, my lead designer gave me the chance to handle projects I can finally call my "own", <a href="https://sensortower.com/android/ph/voyager-innovations-inc/app/eat-bulaga-mobile/tv.eatbulagamobile/overview" target="_blank">EatBulaga! Mobile</a>, and <a href="https://app.lendr.com.ph/" target="_blank">Lendr</a>. Both of which were successfully launched into the market. But in January 2017, I decided to leave my job.</p>

          <div class="separator"><h4>...</h4></div>

          <h3>Why did I leave my first job?</h3>

          <p>Despite all the benefits I was getting from my job (crème de la crème HMO, 15th month pay bonus, flexible working hours, wonderful people, etc.), I finally decided to leave, and I joined a well-funded start-up company.</p>

          <p>It was the uncertainty of possibilities, personal growth, and career advancement that motivated me to leave my first company to join a start-up. I wanted the challenge of it and it was worth the jump :)</p>

          <p>I even wrote a <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/4-lessons-i-should-have-learned-in-the-beginning-of-my-design-career-82dab7e9081c" target="_blank">Medium article</a> about the things I've learned in the beginning of my design career. There's just so much to learn!</p>

          <div class="separator"><h4>...</h4></div>

          <h3>What am I busy with now?</h3>

          <p>Just recently, I realized that knowing our users and their needs in a particular context should be of utmost importance in any product design. Great products go beyond the looks, are relevant to their users, and often have good usability, therefore, I too am going beyond the looks, beyond "visual design".</p>

          <p>Currently, I am learning different aspects of what makes a great product great and so far touched marketing, human psychology and user-centric design thinking.</p>

          <div class="separator"><h4>...</h4></div>

          <h3>Any exciting stories to share? Aside from work.</h3>

          <p>I am always up for challenges and trying out new things. This explains my drive in joining hackathons (overnight app ideation and development competition), meet-ups, hiking, and travels around the Philippines.</p>

          <p>In <a href="http://smart.com.ph/About/newsroom/press-releases/2015/10/02/app-to-reduce-carbon-footprint-wins-hack-the-climate-manila-gets-support-from-smart" target="_blank">HackTheClimate Manila 2015</a>, our team of 5 won the 1st place with our gamified eco-friendly bicycle app called "re/cycle". This gave us the chance to be part of the <a href="https://web.facebook.com/redwizardeventsmanagement/" target="_blank">group</a> behind many hackathons and tech-events as mentors. We also travelled around the Philippines to introduce hackathon to many provinces such as <a href="http://aboitizeyes.aboitiz.com/hack-play-invades-iloilo/" target="_blank">Ilo-ilo</a>, <a href="http://www.gizmomanila.com/2015/10/hack-climate-codefest-goes-to-bicol.html" target="_blank">Bicol</a>, <a href="http://www.geekypinas.com/2016/08/unionbank-held-countrys-first-ever-uhac-at-cebu-city.html" target="_blank">Cebu</a>, <a href="http://www.psst.ph/hack-the-climate-clean-techloban/" target="_blank">Tacloban</a>.</p>
