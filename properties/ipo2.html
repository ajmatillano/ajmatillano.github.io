        <h2>Why Go Public?</h2>
        <hr/>
        <p>Going public and offering your stock in an Initial Public Offering (IPO) represents a milestone for most privately owned companies.
          <br/>One of the key benefits and going public is the ability to raise funds needed for the companyâ€™s expansion and reduce the huge burden of having to borrow money from the banks and paying the high interest rates.</p>
        <p>Going public also gives the company greater credibility, better image and brand equity as a publicly listed company. One of the biggest advantages for a company to have its shares publicly traded is having their stock listed on a stock exchange.</p>
        <p>The main reason companies decide to go public is to raise money and enable the original shareholders to cash in some of their investments while still retaining their interest in the company</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Raise funds by issuing the stocks</p></li>
          <li><p>Acquire other companies through the stocks</p></li>
          <li><p>Offer stock options to recruit and retain top talents</p></li>
          <li><p>Greater credibility, better image and brand equity as a publicly listed company</p></li>
          <li><p>Attract the attention of mutual and hedge funds, market makers and institutional traders</p></li>
        </ul>

      <h3>LISTING CRITERIA</h3>
      <div style="padding-left: 20px">
        <div class="label2">
        <p>1. Strong Management</p>
        <p>2. Strong Growth Pattern</p>
        <p>3. Over 3 Years in operation</p>
        <p>4. Minimum Annual Sales above US$10 million</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <br/>

      <h3>WHERE IS THE LISTING</h3>
      <div>
        <p>You will be listed on the OTC United States.</br/>
        OTC Markets Group is a United States financial market located in New York.<br/>
        OTC Markets provide information for almost 10,000 OTC (Over-the-Counter) securities.</p>
      </div>

      <br/>

      <h3>WHAT IS OTC?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>OTC (Over-the-Counter) markets are primarily used to trade bonds, currencies, derivatives and structured products. They can also be used to trade shares or equities, such as the OTCQX, OTCQB and OTC Pink marketplaces. Broker-dealers that operate in the OTC markets in the United States are regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).</p>
      </div>

      <br/>

      <h3>WHY LIST ON THE OTC?</h3>
      <div>
        <p>The United States capital markets offer a tremendous opportunity for growth and expansion to startup companies as well as long established companies and especially for international companies that hope to gain access to the International investor capital.
        <br/>  <br/>
        <b>International Investors</b><br/>
        If your company intends on raising more capital or looking to provide liquidity to your current shareholders, then listing a company on the over-the-counter market is the way to go. The OTC market attracts investors from across the world. It can raise your company profile and funds at the same time.
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Less Stringent</b><br/>
        Listing on the OTC offers a less stringent and more affordable route as compared to bigger exchanges such as NASDAQ, NYSE or AMEX.  You may opt to list on NASDAQ, NYSE or AMEX at a later stage once your company has grown to a sizeable size and the means to manage the stricter listing compliance of NASDAQ or NYSE.
        </p>
      </div>

      <h3>COMPANY VALUATION</h3>
      <div>
        <p>There are many variables to be considered before anyone can derive on a valuation.
        The company profile, track records, industry, current and future market conditions etc.
        <br/>
        A simple guide but certainly not a final one is based on your current profits and multiply them by 10 to 15.
        Some companies do achieve a much higher valuation based on their business models, current and future potentials.
