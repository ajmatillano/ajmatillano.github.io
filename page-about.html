              <p>To learn more about my professional and educational background, please view my resume <a tabindex="2" href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ahu4vuvh9oxpni6/resume.pdf?dl=0" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

              <h4 class="font-bold" tabindex="3">How did I start my career as a UI Designer?</h4>
              <p> Back in 2013 when I was a recent graduate of Bachelor's Degree in Information Technology, Voyager Innovations Inc. was just starting up. Fortunately, I was given the privilege to be part of its unique cadetship program with benefits a fresh graduate could ever ask for. I started as an "Associate UI Designer", a job title not yet popular in the Philippines at that time.</p>

              <p>And after a year of close mentorship, my lead designer gave me the chance to handle projects I can finally call my "own", EatBulaga! Mobile, and Lendr. Both of which were successfully launched into the market. But in January 2017, I decided to leave my job.</p>

              <div class="cell small-12 medium-12 large-12 divider-horizontal"><h5>•••</h5></div>

              <h4 class="font-bold" tabindex="4">Why did I leave my first job?</h4>
              <p>Despite all the benefits I was getting from my job (crème de la crème HMO, 15th month pay bonus, flexible working hours, wonderful people, etc.), I finally decided to leave, and I joined a well-funded start-up company.</p>

              <p>It was the uncertainty of possibilities, personal growth, and career advancement that motivated me to leave my first company to join a start-up. I wanted the challenge of it and it was worth the jump :)</p>

              <p>I even wrote a <a href="https://blog.prototypr.io/4-lessons-i-should-have-learned-in-the-beginning-of-my-design-career-82dab7e9081c" target="_blank">Medium article</a> about the things I've learned in the beginning of my design career. There's just so much to learn!</p>

              <h4 class="font-bold" tabindex="5">What am I busy with now outside my day-job?</h4>
              <p>As of June 23, 2020, one of the positive things that the covid-19 pandemic has brought into my life is the oppotunity to work on various digital products outside work that will benefit not just humans, but also animals:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>"Focus Coach", a MacOS desktop application that helps people prioritize their tasks using the Eisenhower's Decision Matrix.</li>
                <li>"HuntWiz", a web-based and easy-to-use recruitment platform that any recruiter can afford.</li>
                <li>"Animal Exchange", an online fund-raising platform to clone endangered animals in South Africa. We also started raising funds to help fight against Covid-19 in South Africa by supplying masks, food, and medicines from the raised funds.</li>
              </ul>

              <h4 class="font-bold" tabindex="6">Did you create this website yourself?</h4>
              <p>Yes! :) Obviously I did the design, but I also developed it myself using <a href="https://get.foundation/" target="_blank">Zurb's Foundation</a> as the CSS framework for the grid. It's currently hosted in <a href="https://github.com/ajmatillano/ajmatillano.github.io" target="_blank">Github Pages</a> for free. Creating and updating my website serves as my web development refresher.</p>

              <h4 class="font-bold" tabindex="7">Any exciting stories to share? Aside from work.</h4>
              <p>I am always up for challenges and trying out new things. This explains my drive in joining hackathons (overnight app ideation and development competition), meet-ups, hiking, and travels around the Philippines.</p>

              <p>In <a href="http://smart.com.ph/About/newsroom/press-releases/2015/10/02/app-to-reduce-carbon-footprint-wins-hack-the-climate-manila-gets-support-from-smart" target="_blank">HackTheClimate Manila</a> 2015, our team of 5 won the 1st place with our gamified eco-friendly bicycle app called "re/cycle". This gave us the chance to be part of the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/redwizardph/" target="_blank">company</a> behind many hackathons and tech-events as mentors. We also travelled around the Philippines to introduce hackathon to many provinces such as <a href="http://aboitizeyes.aboitiz.com/hack-play-invades-iloilo/" target="_blank">Ilo-ilo</a>, <a href="http://www.gizmomanila.com/2015/10/hack-climate-codefest-goes-to-bicol.html" target="_blank">Bicol</a>, <a href="http://www.geekypinas.com/2016/08/unionbank-held-countrys-first-ever-uhac-at-cebu-city.html" target="_blank">Cebu</a>,Tacloban.</p>
